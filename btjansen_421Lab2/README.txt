Activity 1 info:
The program will only work with the default.json that was provided, R8 was not implemented.

NOTE: When running activity1.js in the command line, after the 20sec or 2min timers go off the input text will appear to type 2 letters per keystroke instead 
of one. I do not know why this happens and it did not happen in my eclipse IDE. It does NOT affect Eliza's ability to understand and the log will still show
the correct inputs, but the command line inputs will be doubled.

Activity 2 info:
The program will only work with the default.json that was provided, R8 was not implemented.
the 'log' function will only track the current conversation, so it will be cleared when 'quit' is entered.
