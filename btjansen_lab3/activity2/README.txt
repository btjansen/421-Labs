Activity 2:
To add new question/response sets to survey.txt please use the same syntax as the previous sets. Must have 1 empty line between each set, then the question followed by the responses each on their own line
New sets must be added to the end of the file.
New question/response sets may require clearing out the answers.txt of the previous surveys with fewer responses.
